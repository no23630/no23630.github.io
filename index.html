   <div style="font-size:200%; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 50%; margin-top:0px;  text-decoration:underline; text-decoration-color: #CECEF6;"><b>1. Shibuya</b></div>
   <p><img  src="Shibuya.jpg" alt="Shibuya" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 50%;display:block;"> </p>
   <p style="font-size:150%; margin:50px;">Here is one of the most crowded places and the site for the famed<b> "Shibuya crossing"</b>. 
   Shibuya is mainly popular among younger people and is known as <span style="background-color:#A9D0F5"> "the city" </span>area. There are many pastimes and activities such as karaoke, shopping malls, restaurants, and shrines... leaving the impression that just one day might not be enough for the tedious travellers.
   When you first arrive at Shibuya station, you will see a dog statue: <b>"Hachiko"</b>, which is a representative figure of this place and people often use it as a meeting point or for taking touristy pictures. 
   I strongly recommend you to do some shopping at  <span class="shibuyaya">109 </span>which is known to cater to fashion trends of young women. 
   Next you need to walk for a bit, however visiting  <span class="shibuyaya">Meiji Shrine </span>is a historical hotspot not to be missed.
   You should also get lunch at  <span class="shibuyaya">Gyukatsu Motomura, </span>which is famous for their fried beef cutlet. 
   There is always a long line, but it is worth to wait for the tender and juicy meat that is about to come. 
   Savory foods are always best paired with a sugary snack, and what better place to satisfy your sweet tooth than <span class="shibuyaya"> Shiawase no pancake</span>?
   This is the crowned champion for fluffy pancakes. After your food adventure, if you want to get a souvenir you should definitely visit <span class="shibuyaya"> "Mega Don Quijote"</span>, 
   which has anything and everything at the cheapest price, such as home applications, cosmetics, food, drinks, and toys.    </p>

   <p><img src="Shinjuku.jpg" alt="Shinjuku" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 50%;display:block;"></p>
   <p style="font-size:150%;">
 Shinjuku is similar to Shibuya, but it is geared more towards adults since there are many restaurant bars called <span class="shinjukuku">Izakayas </span>to enjoy a drink or ten. 
 Izakayas are one of the most iconic experiences of Japanese culture, as you may see many businessmen in suits yet downing beers like an undergrad student.
 They serve a variety of foods and drinks ranging from croquettes, edamame, ramen, to the holy grail of Japanese liquor:  <span style="background-color:#A9F5BC">sake.</span>
 There are two main areas to try out izakayas, one being <span class="shinjukuku"> "Omoideyokochou" </span>where the alley shows off an old yet nostalgic atmosphere of post war Japan. 
 Another one is <span class="shinjukuku">"Kabuki chou" </span>, the red light district in which Shinjuku earned its title as the <b>city that never sleeps. </b>
 It has many izakayas, but also a unique  <span class="shinjukuku">"robot restaurant"  </span>where you can enjoy extraordinary light shows every night for, of course, an extraordinary fee.  
    </p>

   <p><img src="shimokitazawa.jpg" alt="Shimokitazawa" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 50%;display:block;"></p>
   <p style="font-size:150%;">
   <b>Retro</b> would be the best word for expressing Shimokitazawa out of all the adjectives in the Webster dictionary. 
   You can find many walls or door shutters with unique drawings fashioning a light <span style="background-color:#F7819F">"hipster" </span>era.
   I strongly recommend you to do some shopping here and you can find cheap second hand clothes or limited hand-made accessories. 
   If you are a movie fan, you cannot miss <span class="shimokitaza"> "Shimokita Toriwood" </span>which is a movie theater only in Shimokitazawa and has a small 47 seat venue.
   They mainly show short films made by rising young directors, however every turn of the century they premiere megahit movies such as <i>"Your Name"</i> and <i>"The Voices of a Distant Star."</i> 
   There are also many unique restaurants namely <span class="shimokitaza">"Honya B & B"</span>, in which the abbreviation stands for beer and books. 
   For those not into local brews, there is also a side selection of coffees. There are always events by young writers and editors hosted there. 
   For dessert, what about<em> "natto doughnuts"</em>? Not to be mistaken with not yo doughnuts, Natto store <span class="shimokitaza"> "Sendaiya"</span> has a signature doughnut made from natto that is surprisingly refreshing and not repulsive as regular natto.

   <p style="font-size:150%;">
   If you come to "Tokyo", you need to visit the place that it is named after, <b>Tokyo station.</b>
   Despite its overwhelming underground maze-like structure, this place has the most convenient train access to anywhere in the greater Tokyo region, so it's the best to start your trip from here! 
   If you were to browse however, you should visit the <span class="to">"Tokyo station Ichiban Gai"</span> which is located at Tokyo station Yaesu exit.
   You can find the best souvenirs from all over the world here; for example, from<span class="to"> "Okashi Land" </span> <small>(Okashi translates to candy in Japanese). </small>
   Taking a gander, it is also easy to spot the three biggest Japanese candy companies, <em>"Calbee", "Ezaki Glico",</em> and <em>"Morinaga& Co" </em> with their own Cirque du Soleil phantasma through the visual aesthetics of confectionary art.
   You can also get limited edition sweets which are only sold in Tokyo station. While you are there, you should also definitely try <span class="to">"Calbee plus",</span> which are chips fried fresh directly in-store. 
   If you are looking for the most popular souvenir, it would be the <span class="to">"Tokyo banana"</span>, a fluffy cake containing caramel banana flavored custard cream inside. 
   There are also interesting streets, one of which is the<span class="to"> "Tokyo Ramen Street" </span>that has the five best ramen restaurant chains gathered from all throughout Tokyo. 
   It opens from morning to night, so you can try a  <span style="background-color:#DA81F5">"ramen breakfast".</span> Another one is the <span class="to"> "Tokyo Character Street" </span> which has tons of character stores such as <i> Hello Kitty, Miffy,</i> and <i>Snoopy.</i>
   They are popular not only with kids, but also adults.

   <p style="font-size:150%;">
   Ebisu is one of the most fashionable places in Tokyo.
   When starting your journey, you should walk though <span class="ebi">Ebisu Garden Place,</span> a grandiose red carpet <em>city within a city</em>depicted in multiple movies.
   Especially during winter, illuminations cover the surrounding buildings and you can enjoy shopping, movies, and strolling through museums with a flamboyant view. 
   You also should wine and dine at <span class="ebi">"Ebisu Yokochou" </span>which has a busy Japanese atmosphere with multiple stalls offering<strong> Oden </strong>and <strong>Kushiyaki</strong> on their menu. 
   <span class="ebi"> "Ebisu Dagashiya bar" </span>would be the best place for dessert where you can pick the all-you-can-eat <b>Dagashi</b> <small>(traditional Japanese sweets) </small>at only five dollars.

 Akihabara is what some would say, an <span style="background-color:#BE81F7">Otaku heaven </span>...
 the holy land of anime. To start your pilgrimage, make your way on to a <big> Maid cafe </big>, where cute girls dressed in maid costumes serve their temporary <em> masters  </em>a handmade dish.
 The most popular one would be <span class="aki"> Akiba Zettai Ryoiki </span>in which the concept is a place created by the gods for cats to take on a human form to pay a debt of kindness back to humans.
 Their food menu is also very interesting such as <b> Moe Moe Pink Ramen </b><small>(Moe means to have a feeling of strong affection);</small>?
 you can also ask for the staff to do some performances as well. 
 You also cannot miss a place called the <span class="aki"> owl cafe,</span> where you can drink exquisite coffee with exquisite owls.
 They have many unique owls such as <i>the false barn owl </i>and <i>the Siberian eagle owl</i>, with their round friendly eyes and fluffy wings.

This place is especially popular among teenage girls and you can do shop, eat, and enjoy a few performances as well.
